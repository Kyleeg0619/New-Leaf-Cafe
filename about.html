            <p>
              Located at 606 & 608 Main Street in Riverton, Ezra Perkins erected
              the house in 1889 and then built a small building on the right
              side as a butcher shop, circa 1900. The property was sold to a
              prosperous Riverton pharmacist, William Stiles, who had his own
              drug store at 526 Main Street. He razed the butcher shop and
              erected a "thoroughly modern drug store and soda water fountain",
              which opened in April 1910. The drug store not only had patent
              medicines but also a small lending library where, for a cent a
              day, one could rent a book to read.
            </p>
          </div>
          <img
            src="images/new-leaf-outside-Historical-Society-of-Riverton-NJ.jpg"
            alt="outside view of the New Leaf building"
            class="responsive-image about-img"
          />
        </div>
        <p class="flex-item">
          The soda fountain was popular, and various toiletries were also part
          of the regular stock. William Stiles and his wife lived in the house
          at 608 Main Street until they built a new home on the corner of Thomas
          and Midway. Stiles owned the store until 1936 when he sold the
          business. In the 1940s, the residence and drug store were purchased by
          Freeman Hunter, who operated a fine furniture store for over 30 years.
        </p>
        <p class="flex-item">
          In 1979, this site became the home of the current gift shop. The
          property was purchased in 2003 by the Rodgers family, lifelong
          residents of this area. The buildings have retained many vintage
          characteristics, such as the original, ornately embossed 15-foot tin
          ceiling; apothecary shelves; showcase windows; pocket doors; and
          arches, corbels, and moldings. The two structures are connected by an
          enclosed walkway that was originally used when the druggist was called
          for at night. The passageway now serves as an entrance to the formal
          Victorian tea room, which occupies the first floor of the 1889 house.
